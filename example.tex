    \begin{abstract}
        The presented \LaTeX\ preamble/template is tailored for writing physics lab
        reports, featuring specialized tcolorboxes for clarity and emphasis. These
        include ``Forschungsfrage'' for defining the research question, ``Aufgabe'' for
        guiding tasks, and nested ``Mainbox'' for crucial content. The template allows
        seamless citing and showcases potential for becoming a comprehensive package.
        Its organization and visual appeal offer promising prospects for enhancing
        physics report writing.
    \end{abstract}
\end{titlingpage}





This is ideally becoming a package or class later, but for now a preamble will do.

The preamble is optimized to write physic lab reports, additions with it are
useful/needed packages. Another addition are the following tcolorboxes:
    



\section{tcolorboxes}
\label{sec:tcol}


\begin{ff}{Forschungsfrage}
    ff, for Forschungsfrage, black colframe to stand out, use this only once to define the reasearch question.
\label{Forschungsfrage}
\end{ff}


\begin{aufgabe}{Aufgabe}
    aufgabe, to define the questions given in the tasksheet, these are to be
    removed later, just to guide while writing, thus they were made red.
\label{aufgabe-1}
\end{aufgabe}


\begin{mainbox}{Mainbox}
    mainbox, this is for important things, maybe something like the following:

% Nested mainbox
\begin{mainbox}{Erkenntnis}
    Daraus ergibt sich
    \[ F_{el} \propto \frac{1}{r^2} .\] 
\end{mainbox}
\end{mainbox}


\begin{subbox}{subbox}
    subbux, for less important things, that are still highlight worthy.
\end{subbox}


\begin{subsubbox}
    subsubbox, to highlight something, but without title.
\end{subsubbox}

here are the boxes nested
\begin{mainbox}{Here you}
    \begin{ff}{can see}
        \begin{aufgabe}{a lot of}
            \begin{subbox}{nested}
                \begin{subsubbox}
                    boxes
                \end{subsubbox}
            \end{subbox}
        \end{aufgabe}
    \end{ff}
\end{mainbox}



\section{Citing}
One cites as usual, e.g. ``The \TeX{}book''~\cite{knuth1986texbook}\\
There is no addition yet, it already makes very much sense.
